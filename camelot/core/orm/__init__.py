"""This module complements the sqlalchemy orm module, it contains the global
`Session` factory to create `session` objects.  Whenever a `session`
is needed it can be constructed with a call of `Session` ::
    
    session = Session
        
when using Elixir, Elixir needs to be told to use this session factory ::
    
    elixir.session = Session

when using Declarative, this module contains an `Entity` class that can
be used as a `declarative_base` and has some classes that mimic Elixir
behavior
